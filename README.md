# .Command

![Unity Command Line Tool](https://dotcommand-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/suggestions.svg)

.Command is a powerful Command Line Processor and log viewer for Unity â€” inspired by similar tools in Unreal Engine. It runs in both the Unity Editor and built players for any platform, letting you inspect logs and call stacks in production builds without digging through log files.

It also allows you to execute any runtime code in your game with a button press.

## Getting Started

1. Grab the latest release from the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/ArtOfSettling/dotCommand/releases).
2. Import the unity package into your unity project.
3. Drag the WellFired/WellFired.Command/Platform/Prefabs/DebugConsoleLoader.prefab into any scene and you are done!

## Dev Environment Setup

If you're contributing or building the Unity package yourself, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Unity (6.1 LTS or newer recommended)
- Node.js (we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install)

```bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

### Install Build Tools

Install Jake (task runner) and CoffeeScript compiler:

```bash
npm install -g jake coffeescript
```

> **Note:** Global install is required for CLI commands like `jake` to work in terminal.

### Verify Setup

Run the following to list available tasks:

```bash
jake -T
```

To build the Unity `.unitypackage` export:

```bash
jake unity:export-package -c
```

This will print a message like:

```
[INFO] Using unity path: /Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/...
```

The built `.unitypackage` will be located under the `unity/` directory.

## Using the Unity Project

You can also just open the Unity project located at `/unity/` in the Unity Hub to explore or test the package in action.

## Input System Compatibility

.Command supports toggling the in-game console with the backquote key (`` ` ``). If you're using Unity's **new Input System**, make sure to:
